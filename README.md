# Flood_analysis
Important files and images required while exploring on ways to visaulize flood affected areas using google earth engine.

At first, we scrapped the data from the meterological department of Nepal to find out the dry and rainy seasons. <br>
After that, we also extracted the shp file of the region which is flooded mostly during the rainy seasons in Nepal (Biratnagar city). It is surrounded by two major rivers Singhia and Kesaliya. <br>
With the help of google earth engine, and utilization of the change detection and thresholding algorithms we were able to identify the flood affected regions after major flood events. <br>
